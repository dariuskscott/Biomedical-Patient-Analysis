# Biomedical-Patient-Analysis

Each patient in the dataset is represented by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis
and lumbar spine (in this order): pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. 

The goal of this project is to evaluate different methods for predicting two classes: Normal (NO) and abnormal (AB).
